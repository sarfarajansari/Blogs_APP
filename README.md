# Blog App 📝

A **Django-powered blog application** that lets users create, customize, and share their own blogs with a personalized touch. Featuring custom themes, authentication, and a clean UI, this app provides an engaging blogging experience for both writers and readers.

> **Note**: I built this app when I was in 11th grade, diving into the world of Django and front-end design with Bootstrap. This project was my entry point into web development, combining my interests in coding and creative design! Thanks to CS50 where I learnt DJANGO!
